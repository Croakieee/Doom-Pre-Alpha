Title                   : DOOM Alpha v0.3 (aka "DOOM Pre-Alpha")
Filename                : doom0_3.zip
Release date            : 28 February 1993

Description             : This is the long-rumored v0.3 alpha, built by
                          id Software on February 28, 1993, almost one 
                          month later than the v0.2 tech demo and 2 months
                          earlier than the much further progressed v0.4.
                          Notable features include several maps in their
                          earliest known forms and a fully functional
                          on-screen automap. Though apparently never
                          released to id's alpha testers, this build was
                          sent to several industry professionals for
                          comment and review, whereby it has been 
                          successfully preserved. It much more fully 
                          displays the DOOM engine in its earliest state
                          than the tech demo, with an internal 
                          architecture significantly different and less 
                          advanced than later builds. Crashes will be
                          common, especially when walking over two-sided
                          lines. The README file promises a more proper
                          release to follow in two weeks, but such a 
                          release is not presently known to exist.
