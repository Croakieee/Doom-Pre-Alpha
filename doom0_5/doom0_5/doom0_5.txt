In order to create a complete collection of historic DOOM versions, as
released to testers at the time, id Software has allowed to place this
file, the May 22, 1993 alpha version of DOOM, in the official idgames
archive.

This file is collected here because of the historic interest shown in it,
and is not supported by id Software in ANY way.  Please do NOT contact
id Software about this file.  If you ignore this request, you will be
summarily BFG-ed :)
