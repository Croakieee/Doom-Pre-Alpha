THINGS.&lt;br /&gt;FLATNAME lists the floor and ceiling textures, which were of course later&lt;br /&gt;merged into SECTORS.  The others are pretty obvious.  Structures like SEGS,&lt;br /&gt;BLOCKMAP and NODES were apparently added later to improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something that looks like a "-savepcx" parameter in the .exe, and&lt;br /&gt;messages like "IO_ScreenShot: Couldn't create an LBM" and "Screen saved",&lt;br /&gt;but I haven't found a way to actually produce screen shots.  There must be&lt;br /&gt;a way, since the doompix1.exe screen shots are older than this .exe.  The&lt;br /&gt;same goes for recording demos, as there are 4 demos included in the .wad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame rate dots (-devparm in the final game) are permanently enabled.&lt;br /&gt;At the start of each level, the four players (all green) are already there,&lt;br /&gt;but of course only one moves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are references to "actors" in the .exe, so some terminology from the&lt;br /&gt;Wolfenstein 3D engine was inherited into id's next engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this concludes my nostalgia trip. :-)&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Frans P. de Vries | fpv@xymph.iaf.nl | Rec.Games.Computer.Doom FAQ maintainer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
